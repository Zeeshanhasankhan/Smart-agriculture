# Smart-agriculture
This is Smart agriculture using ESP32 this is a IOT project which works with a Wi-Fi connection.
We can use this project like a Polly house it will care of your plant according to needs and we can see all the updates (Temperature, Moisture, Water pump ) and also control the water pump manually on our phone from any place.

This is smart agriculture project using ESP32 ( Microcontroller ), Servo motor (For give fertilizer to plant ) , Soil moisture sensor (for Sense moisture near plant ) , DHT11 sensor ( for sense temperature near plant ) , LCD 16x2 ( that not compulsory but we can use it to display the temp, moisture and humidity ).

guide:- 
How to use my code in your project?
* Servo : There are three wire in Servomotor we have to connect "red wire" with "3.3v / 5v or vin" pin of ESP32.
              "grey wire" will be connect with "Gnd of ESP32".
              "yellow wire" will be in pin number " d12 of ESP32".
             
*Soil moisture Sensor : There are three pins in Soil moisture sensor " VCC, GND, OUT".
                                    "VCC" with any + power "3.3v / 5v or vin" pin of ESP32 ".
                                    "GND" with "GND of ESP32".
                                    "OUT" with " D35 ".
* DHT11 Sensor: There are three pins in DHT11  " VCC, GND, OUT".
                                    "VCC" with any + power "3.3v / 5v or vin" pin of ESP32 ".
                                    "GND" with "GND of ESP32".
                                    "OUT" with " D13 ".
*LCD_I2C : LCD_I2C have 4 pins
                                    "VCC" with "5v or 3.3 v".
                                    "gnd" with "GND"
                                     and others A0 and A1.
